- Generates a synthetic dataset to train the model.
- Fully open-source and free to use.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Pandas** (Data Handling)
- **Streamlit** (Web Application Framework)
- **Joblib** (Model Serialization)
- **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)
